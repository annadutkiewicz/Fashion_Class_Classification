## Fashion_Class_Classification
### Description

**The aim is to predict type of clothes on the image**

There are 10 classes available:  
- 0 => T-shirt/top
- 1 => Trouser
- 2 => Pullover
- 3 => Dress
- 4 => Coat
- 5 => Sandal
- 6 => Shirt
- 7 => Sneaker
- 8 => Bag
- 9 => Ankle boot

### Workflow
1. Data import
- Load libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Load dataset

### Conclusions
1. Using SVM machine learning technique we were able to classify cancer type with 97% accuracy
2. Misclassified samples were all type 1 errors which means that the patients had cancer but cancer was just benign, not malignant as per classification
